# Current Status - assert-struct Development

## Session Summary (2025-01-16)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Wildcard Pattern Support (`_`)** - COMPLETED ✅
   - Added full support for wildcard patterns that ignore values while asserting existence
   - Fixed the core parsing issue by adding wildcard detection to `check_for_special_syntax()`
   - Works in all contexts: struct fields, `Some(_)`, tuples, slices
   - PR #21 created and pushed to `wildcard-pattern` branch

### Key Discoveries
- **Empty collections (`[]`)** already work - no changes needed
- **Wildcard misconception**: Initially thought `Some(_)` wouldn't work due to Rust parser limitations, but this was wrong - the issue was in our `check_for_special_syntax()` function not recognizing `_` as special syntax

## Current Branch Status
- **Branch**: `wildcard-pattern` 
- **PR**: #21 (https://github.com/carllerche/assert-struct/pull/21)
- **Status**: Ready for review/merge

## Roadmap from docs/roadmap.md

### Priority 1: Critical Features for AST Testing

1. **Vec/Array Index Access Patterns** ❌ Not Implemented
   ```rust
   // Proposed syntax:
   assert_struct!(func, ItemFn {
       sig.inputs[0]: FnArg::Typed { ... },
       sig.inputs[1]: FnArg::Typed { ... },
   });
   ```

2. **Method Call Assertions** ❌ Not Implemented
   ```rust
   // Proposed syntax:
   assert_struct!(func, ItemFn {
       sig.asyncness.is_some(): true,
       sig.inputs.len(): 2,
   });
   ```

3. **Wildcard Patterns** ✅ COMPLETED (PR #21)
   - `Some(_)` for is_some() checks
   - `field: _` for ignoring field values
   - Works in tuples and slices too

4. **Box/Deref Pattern Matching** ❌ Not Implemented
   ```rust
   // Proposed syntax:
   assert_struct!(type, RefType {
       elem: Box<Type::Path { ... }>,
   });
   ```

### Priority 2: Common Convenience Features

5. **Length/Count Assertions** ❌ Not Implemented
   ```rust
   // Proposed syntax:
   assert_struct!(item, ItemTrait {
       items.len(): 1,
       // Alternative: items: [_; 1],
   });
   ```

6. **Empty Collection Assertions** ✅ Already Works
   ```rust
   assert_struct!(func, ItemFn {
       sig.inputs: [],  // Works!
   });
   ```

### Priority 3: Advanced Pattern Matching

7. **Partial Vec/Slice Matching with Wildcards** ✅ Partially Works
   - `[1, _, 3]` works with wildcard support
   - Still need rest patterns in specific positions

8. **Pattern Guards/Conditional Patterns** ❌ Not Implemented

9. **Custom Matcher Functions** ❌ Not Implemented

10. **String Pattern Extensions** ❌ Not Implemented (only regex works)

## Recent Error Message Improvements (Already Merged)

- ✅ Fancy error formatting with pattern context
- ✅ Pattern underlining showing exact failure location  
- ✅ Field path tracking (e.g., `user.profile.age`)
- ✅ 4-space consistent indentation (avoiding rightward drift)
- ✅ Smart value abbreviation for complex nested structures

## Known Limitations (from KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md)

1. **Type constraints**: Comparison operators require `PartialOrd`
2. **Regex compilation**: String literals compile at macro expansion, expressions at runtime
3. **Enum limitations**: Multi-field tuple enums need individual field patterns
4. **Collection patterns**: 
   - Can't mix element patterns with length assertions
   - Rest patterns (`..`) only work at slice end
5. **Error collection**: Currently single error, multiple errors in progress

## Next High-Value Features to Implement

Based on the AST testing use case analysis:

1. **Vec/Array Index Access** - Would eliminate many separate assertions in parser tests
2. **Method Call Assertions** - Essential for checking `is_some()`, `len()`, etc. without wildcards
3. **Box/Deref Patterns** - Common in AST structures

## Files Modified in This Session

- `assert-struct-macros/src/parse.rs` - Added wildcard detection to `check_for_special_syntax()`
- `assert-struct-macros/src/lib.rs` - Added `Pattern::Wildcard` variant
- `assert-struct-macros/src/expand.rs` - Wildcard expansion logic in all contexts
- `assert-struct/src/error.rs` - Added `PatternNode::Wildcard` and `Fragment::Wildcard`
- `assert-struct/tests/wildcard.rs` - Comprehensive wildcard tests (NEW)

## Important Code Patterns Discovered

### The `check_for_special_syntax()` Function
This is the critical disambiguation point that determines whether parenthesized content like `Some(...)` contains special pattern syntax or is just a simple expression. Any new pattern syntax needs to be added here.

### Pattern Expansion Strategy
Wildcards generate `_` in match patterns (not bindings), which Rust's pattern matching handles natively. No assertions are generated for wildcards - they just participate in the match.

### Token Tree Parsing
Proc macros CAN capture `_` tokens just fine using token trees (`tt`). The initial confusion about parser limitations was incorrect - the issue was in our parsing logic, not Rust's parser.

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test wildcard

# Test without regex feature  
cargo test --no-default-features

# Run clippy (ALWAYS before committing)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Expand macros for debugging
cargo expand --test wildcard
```

## Session End Notes

The wildcard feature is complete and ready for review. The implementation was simpler than initially thought - just needed to recognize `_` as special syntax. This pattern (checking for special syntax) will be important for any future pattern additions.

The roadmap shows several valuable features remaining, with Vec/Array index access being the most impactful for the AST testing use case that motivated this work.
