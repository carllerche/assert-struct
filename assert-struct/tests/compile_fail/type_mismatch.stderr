error[E0277]: can't compare `u32` with `&str`

   |              ^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `u32 == &str`
   |
   = help: the trait `PartialEq<&str>` is not implemented for `u32`
           but trait `PartialEq<u32>` is implemented for it
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected `u32`, found `&str`
   = note: required for `&u32` to implement `PartialEq<&&str>`
