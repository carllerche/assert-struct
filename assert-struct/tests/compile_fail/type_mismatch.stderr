   |
   = help: the trait `PartialEq<String>` is not implemented for `u32`
           but trait `PartialEq<u32>` is implemented for it
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected `u32`, found `String`
   = note: required for `&u32` to implement `PartialEq<&String>`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_struct` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
