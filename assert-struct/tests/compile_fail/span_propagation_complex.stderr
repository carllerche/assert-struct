   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `&ValueStream: Iterator`
           which is required by `&mut &ValueStream: Iterator`
           `ValueStream: Iterator`
           which is required by `&mut ValueStream: Iterator`
note: the trait `Iterator` must be implemented

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the trait `Iterator` defines an item `collect`, but is explicitly unimplemented
